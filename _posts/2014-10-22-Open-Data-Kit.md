###Jamaican Government Sees the Economic Value of Data
I read an encouraging newspaper [article](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20141010/lead/lead7.html) yesterday that hints that the Jamaican government is interested in implimenting an Open Data Policy. Technology minister, Phillip Paulwell, told The Gleaner, "We see the economic value of data, especially data that is owned by the state and data that can be used by the private sector to undertake serious business". 

In an effort to help, I have gathered a useful resource from similar thinking that is happening in our region. Brazil and Mexico are the big pioneers as active [OGP](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Brazillian Government has published their Open Data Policy Kit on github for free with [githubpages](http://github.io). This is helping to make their government more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens. I have translated their document so that we can also benefit from this resource.

###Code on Github
See the version in english [here](https://varunity.github.io/kit/).

Of course I made a fork and attempted to translate it to English with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/). Here is a [link](https://varunity.github.io/kit/) to the current English version that I created. [Fork it in github](https://github.com/varunity/kit) to improve it.
