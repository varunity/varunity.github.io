###Jamaican Government Sees the Economic Value of Data
I read an encouraging newspaper [article](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20141010/lead/lead7.html) yesterday that hints that the Jamaican government is interested in implimenting an Open Data Policy. Technology minister, Phillip Paulwell, told The Gleaner, "We see the economic value of data, especially data that is owned by the state and data that can be used by the private sector to undertake serious business". 

I am very happy to hear this and in an effort to help, I have gathered resources from similar activity happening in our region. Brazil and Mexico are the forward thinkers and big pioneers as active [OGP](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Luckily the Brazillian Government has published their Open Data Policy Kit on github with [githubpages](github.io) which is helping to make their governments more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens.

###Code on Github

Of course I made a fork and attempted to translate it to English with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/). Here is a [link](https://varunity.github.io/kit/) to the current English version that I created. [Fork it in github](https://github.com/varunity/kit) to improve it.
