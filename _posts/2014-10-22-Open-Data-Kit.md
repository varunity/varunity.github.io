I read an encouraging [article](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20141010/lead/lead7.html) in the paper yesterday that hinted at the Jamaican government's interest in implimenting an Open Data Policy.

In order to help, I took a look at what other activity is happening in the region. Brazil and Mexico seem to be pioneering OGP processes in this hemispherei and luckily the Brazillian Government has published it's Open Data Policy Kit on github with [githubpages](github.io).

Of course I made a fork and attempted to translate it to English with Google Translate. Here is a [link](https://varunity.github.io/kit/) to the one in English. [Fork it in github.](https://github.com/varunity/kit)
